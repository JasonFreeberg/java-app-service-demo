## Requirements

Before working through this demo, you must have the following technologies on your machine.

- The Azure CLI
- An Azure account and subscription
- Maven (version 3 or greater)

## Preparation

Complete these steps __before__ meeting a customer or going to a conference.

1. Clone this project

    `git clone https://github.com/JasonFreeberg/java-app-service-demo.git` 

1. Provision a Resource Group and Cosmos DB account

    You can create the resources from the portal or using the CLI. The database name must be lowercase. For CLI users...

    ```bash
    az group create -n <your-azure-group-name> -l <your-resource-group-region>
    az cosmosdb create --kind GlobalDocumentDB -g <your-azure-group-name> -n <your-azure-documentDB-name>
    ```

    Get your database's URI from the Portal or from the JSON response if you used the CLI.

    Lastly, get the `primaryMasterKey` connection key by running this command:

    `az cosmosdb list-keys -g <your-azure-group-name> -n <your-azure-documentDB-name>`

1. Create an App Service instance and set up the scaling rules

    1. Create an App Service instance in the Portal with the following settings:
        - OS --> Linux
        - Publish --> Code
        - Runtime Stack --> Tomcat 9.0 (JRE 8)
        - Create a new App Service plan with ____ and no other apps in it
            - __TODO__: Figure out best tier

    1. Set up scaling rules
        - Navigate to "Scale out (App Service plan)"
        - Click "Enable autoscale"
        - Click "Add Rule", and set the following for "Criteria":
            - Time Aggregation --> Average
            - Metric name --> CPU Percentage
            - Timem grain statistic --> Average
            - Operater --> Greater than
            - Threshold --> 70
            - Duration --> 5 minutes
        - Set the following for "Action":
            - Operation --> Increase count by 
            - Instance count --> 1
            - Cool down (minutes) --> 2
        - __TODO__: Memory instructions

1. Add the name of your App Service instance and the resource group to the pom.xml

1. Export environment variables for your document DB
    - Enter your Cosmos DB URI, name, and primary master key in `set-env-vars.sh`
    - Execute the script
        - Powershell: 
        - Bash:

## Pitching Notes

- They can deploy a container and use the Azul JDK
    - Add Git repo with images
- __Managed__ service for Java. No one else has this!!
- Upcoming feature to auto-update the JDK major/minor version, or stay at your current version

## Technical Notes

- Underlying Linux OS
